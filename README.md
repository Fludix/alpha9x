### $|> Release Notes:

# 23/07/21 // 08:09 PM in Germany:
Alpha9x Version 4.57 is finally out now!
It's been a month since I updated Alpha9x.
I added a new Discord Token Brute Force and organized everything good.
There is a new Category called "Others". I added in a Program called Mailify. Good Program tbh!
Anyways, I try my best to not put any virus in my project. My Customer's Privacy and Safety is
my highest Priority.

# 27/06/21 // 05:00 PM in Germany:
I updated the Theme/UI for the Alpha9x Website Project.
-END-

# 18/06/21 // 08:00 PM in Germany:
Alpha9x Version 3.57 is now out!
I categorized the Programs in different Folders, so it looks clean!
I added a Minecraft Account Checker (Minecraft.py), a YouTube Botting
Program, I added another Discord Nitro Generator, I added a DDOS Program
(Low Orbit Ion Cannon) and I added OpenBullet (Anomaly).
RECOMMEND ME ANY PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOOD FOR THE PROJECT. KEEP IN MIND THAT
I WILL CHECK THE FILES FOR ANY SUSPICIOUS MALICIOUS SCRIPTS. SO DO NOT TRY
TO GIVE ME A VIRUS!
-END-

# 02/05/21 // 04:25 PM in Germany:
Alpha9x Version 2.57 is now out!
I only fixed AccountReaper since it didn't work and it didn't have
any Modules.
-END-

# 27/04/21 // 09:01 PM in Germany:
Alpha9x Version 2.56 is now out!
The new Programs are Discord Token Creator, DiscordHaxx and AccountReaper. 
FYI: It says that it is a "virus" with DiscordHaxx and Discord Token
Creator, but they aren't viruses as I tested them out.
I always test the new programs on my VirtualBox, so I can
keep my Customers safe! By the way, if you do use the Token Creator,
please use Process Hacker because the program opens a lot of chrome processes
to create discord accounts, so yeah! If you don't want your ram to be full, then
install Process Hacker and limit your Account Creation (max 10 Tokens for 16gb RAM).
-END-

# 13/04/21 // 03:05 AM in Germany:
Alpha9x is ready to be released!
I have finally finished it's goodies!
Alpha9x is basically a Crack Tool Pack which
includes all the Cracked Tool Programs.
